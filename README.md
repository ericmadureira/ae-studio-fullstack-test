# LA Business

## Description
This application displays data from LA businesses. There's a Node API fetching said data from a 3rd open API, and making it available for a React application to display in the browser.

## How to run
1. Make sure you have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Clone the repo.
3. On a terminal start the API at `./api/` running `node index.ts`. The local server will be available at port 3333.
4. On another terminal, start the front-end app at `./src/` running `yarn start`. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Improvements
