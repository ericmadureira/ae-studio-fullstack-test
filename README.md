# LA Business

## Description
This application displays data from LA businesses. There's a Node API fetching said data from a 3rd open API, and making it available for a React application to display in the browser.

## How to run
1. Make sure you have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Clone the repo.
3. On a terminal start the API at `./api/` running `node index.ts`. The local server will be available at port 3333.
4. On another terminal, start the front-end app at `./src/` running `yarn start`. The application will be available at port http://localhost:3000.

## Tech stack
- react
- typescript
- create-react-app
- styled-components
- node
- express
- axios

## Improvements
- Separate the API and react app
- Responsive layout
- Apply patterns to the local Node API
- Much more (there's a LOT of room for improvement)
